# Report 

  - Report should be a formatted file (Word, LaTeX, notebook, ...; exported as PDF) containing text, pictures, and **essential** parts of code and results. Data files are included as separate files in the ZIP.
  - Report should contain: 
    * title page: HSE, program, course, title, author, creation date / last change date
    * short formulation of the task, description of the data set, goals of analysis/questions to be answered
    * methods used and corresponding results with their interpretation/evaluation
    * summary
    * references and links to external sources

Avoid redundant/"garbage" printouts - for example: messages of attached libraries.
