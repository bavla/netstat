# Projects


For each project write the [report](rep.md) and add the files with programs and constructed data sets (except for very large data). Pack everything in a ZIP file. Send the ZIPs for Project 1 and Project 2 to **vladimir.batagelj@fmf.uni-lj.si**.


## Project 1 

Solve the [problem](prob.md)   with your [number](list.md)+10 with the Monte Carlo method. For example, student with number 3 has to solve the problem 13. If you are able to solve it also theoretically compare both results.

## Project 2 


Do either the **Task A**:

Transform the data from a selected data source into a Markov chain transition matrix with **at least 15 states** and **analyze it**.
For example, the transition matrix from a given text (project Gutenberg) that is determined by consecutive letter pairs.

or **Task B**:

On a **labeled** network of your choice with **at least 15 nodes** and a measured node property (attribute) either
  * Compute Geary's and Moran's measure.
    
or for a selected network property

  * Make a CUG or QAP test. 

Interpret the obtained results.
